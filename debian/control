Description: Xilinx Runtime (XRT) - runtime libraries
 Xilinx Runtime library (XRT) is an open-source easy to
 use software stack that facilitates management and usage of
 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) / Adaptive Compute Acceleration
 Platform (ACAP) devices. Users use familiar programming languages
 like C/C++ or Python to write host code which uses XRT to interact
 with FPGA/ACAP device. XRT exports well defined set of software APIs
 that work across PCIe based datacenter platforms and ZYNQ UltraScale+
 MPSoC/Versal ACAP based embedded platforms. XRT is a combination of
 userspace and kernel driver components.
 .
 This package provides the runtime environment for xrt.
