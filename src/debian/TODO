In no particular order -

* x86 support

  Upstream has out of the box support for x86 but there are some major
  differences between an edge and a cloud build.

  - install location
  - PCIe based FPGA cards
  - cloud provider support

  Ideally, it would be good to be able to test some of this
  functionality while enabling x86 package builds.

* Edge DKMS

  XRT sources have mechanism to include a DKMS driver (zocl) for
  interfacing with the FPGA hardware on edge devices. Enabling the
  drvier would remove the dependency on Xilinx kernel.

* Runpath optimization

  Upstream build files set up CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH but these are based
  on assumptions about install paths. There be efficiences to be
  gained (but also just plain bugs that can be fixed) by adjusting the
  dynamic library search paths for binaries and libraries.


If you're interested in these features or any other features, please
feel free to send a mail or open a bug against the package. As usual
patches are welcome but also confirming a feature on hardware I don't
have access to would be a great help.
